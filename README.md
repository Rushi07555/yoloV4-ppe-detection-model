# yoloV4-ppe-detection-model

Firstly colne the repository using following command in your command prompt

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rushi07555/yoloV4-ppe-detection-model.git
```
# Minimum system requirnment:
1. OS – Windows 10 Pro
2. GPU - GTX1080TI
3. CPU – i5-6400
4. RAM – 16GB

# TensorFlow-GPU 1.11, CUDA v9.0, cuDNN v7.3.1 installation

## Hardware requirements:

1. NVIDIA® GPU card with CUDA® Compute Capability 3.5 or higher
2. Strong enough computer (high end CPU and at least 16 GB of RAM)

## Software requirements:

1. 64-bit Python v3.5+ for windows/Ubuntu.
2. A supported version of Microsoft Visual Studio.Visual Studio 2017
3. CUDA 9.0
4. cuDNN v7.3.1 for Windows 10 / Ubuntu 18.2 and CUDA 10.2

In many places there was said that there is some problems while working on newest CUDA versions, but I took this challenge and installed CUDA v10.0 and cuDNN v7.3.1. As future versions of TensorFlow will be released, you will likely need to continue updating the CUDA and cuDNN versions to the latest supported version. If you face problems while installing CUDA, visit this [documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html) site. If you face problems while installing cuDNN, visit this [documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html#install-windows) site. This tutorial is made for TensorFlow-GPU v1.11, so the “pip install tensorflow-gpu” command should automatically download and install newest 1.11 version.

# Install Python 3.6 64-bit version and install all required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirment.txt
```
